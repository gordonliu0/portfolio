After graduating, I decided to create a personal website to showcase my work, interests, and thoughts. Thus I began the process of designing, developing, and deploying my online profile.


### I’d like to thank the following people for inspiring parts of my site. 

**[Sarah Guo's Blog](https://sarahguo.com/blog)**: Loved her branding, design, recent thoughts section, and essay signup features. 

**[Chronark](https://chronark.com/)**: I forked Chronark’s portfolio as a starting point for my project. The upstash and contentlayer stack streamlines my content management.

**[Anthony Zhou](https://anthonyzhou.com/)**: Anthony is a good friend from back home who inspired me to read and write more. 

**[Hayden Bleasel on Figma](https://www.figma.com/@haydenbleasel)**: Hayden has some great portfolio designs that provided a starting point for my own site.


### Tools I used in the process.

**Macbook Pro 2021**: my laptop

**Apple Notes**: brainstorming and keeping track of my work

**ChatGPT**: writing and brainstorming

**Figma**: design + wireframing

**Linear**: task management

**VS Code**: coding

### To Do List

Here's a look into the future of the portfolio, ranked in highest to lowest priority:
- Add a dedicated contact page. 
- Polish the UI/UX and add more interactivity (looking to collaborate with a graphic designer!) 
- Add a writing page for articles unrelated to my projects.
- Add book summaries to the bookshelf. 
- Add more fun features (chatboard, live users, current toolstack)
